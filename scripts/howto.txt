** create directory on target
> mkdir -p .ssh

** on host generate a new RSA key
# ssh-keygen

** copy the generated id_rsa from ~./ssh to target
# scp id_rsa.pub root@targetip:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

** now it should be possible to ssh into target without password


** remove ssh key for remote
